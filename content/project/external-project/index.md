summary: Pakistan, being an agricultural-centric nation, encounters challenges with its traditional farming methods, which were once dependable. It becomes imperative to embrace contemporary, data-driven approaches for optimizing crop selection. The project employs machine learning models, utilizing Decision Trees in supervised learning and K-means clustering in unsupervised learning, to forecast crop outcomes and discern patterns within soil datasets.
