title: RISC-V Pipelined Architecture
summary: To Convert the Single Cycle Processor into Pipeline, 5 Stages were made which were synchornized with the clock. Along with Program Counter, these include the IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM and MEM/WB stage registers. These 5 stage registers were implemented and then they were integrated in the Top Level Module to make our processor pipelined.
