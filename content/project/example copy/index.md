title: Sign to Speech Glove in Pakistani Context
summary: Sign language is a means of communication that involves the use of hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey meaning. It is primarily used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing, but it can also be used by people who can hear as a way of communicating in noisy environments or for those who want to learn a new language. Despite the benefits of sign language, there are still significant challenges faced by those who use it.

One of the biggest barriers faced by deaf individuals is communication. In Pakistan, sign language is the primary means of communication for the deaf community. However, many hearing individuals in Pakistan do not understand sign language, which can make it difficult for deaf individuals to communicate effectively in many situations.

The sign-to-speech glove can help address this issue by allowing deaf individuals to translate their sign language gestures into spoken words in real time. This can be particularly useful in situations where deaf individuals need to communicate with hearing individuals who do not know sign languages, such as in schools, workplaces, and healthcare settings. To make our understanding of why would our sign-to-speech hardware make a difference we contacted multiple organizations running across Pakistan that work for the betterment of people with such diffi- culties. It included approaching ConnectHear, PakistanSignLangauge, and the Pakistan Association of the Deaf. We also visited KFC millennium branch where mute people are employed at an order pickup counter to ask about their insight on the product.

The existing ASL-to-speech gloves are typically designed to recognize only a small set of signs and translate them into corresponding spoken words. This means that they may not be able to accurately interpret more complex or nuanced signs, which can limit their overall usefulness for communication. n Pakistan, we have a unique Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) that deaf/mute people use. Keeping this in mind the ASL-to-speech gloves are futile. The community we are targeting is Pakistani mute/deaf people. On average it would be rare that any Pakistani would want to invest a huge amount of capital of around lacs to buy these sensory gloves

A proposed solution for this is the use of sign-to-speech sensor gloves. These gloves are equipped with sensors that can detect the movements of the wearer’s hands and fingers as they sign in PSL, and translate these movements into speech. The sign-to-speech sensor gloves would be designed to fit snugly on the wearer’s hands, with sensors placed on the fingertips and along the back of the hand. The sensors would be made up of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and flex sensors, which would measure the orientation, acceleration, and bending of the wearer’s fingers and hands. In this proposed solution, we explored the development of such gloves, and the technology behind them. The first step was to design and fabricate gloves that are comfortable, lightweight, and durable. The gloves would need to be flexible and allow for natural hand movements while also accommodating the sensors required for sign language recognition.
