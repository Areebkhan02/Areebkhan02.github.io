abstract: Swarm robotics is a captivating paradigm where a multitude of miniature robots collaborate to perform complex tasks with precision and speed. Coordination is crucial for seamless collaboration, and advanced algorithms play a pivotal role in optimizing swarm robot behavior. This survey highlights the transformative impact of swarm robots in various domains, such as disaster zone exploration and gas leak detection, and underscores the significance of coordination in achieving efficient and effective outcomes. This research survey explores the importance of advanced algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC), in coordinating swarm robots. The objective is to investigate their potential applications and shed light on their methodologies. The survey delves into the methodologies of PSO and FLC algorithms, which contribute to optimizing swarm robot behavior. PSO fine-tunes the behavior of individual robots by iteratively updating their positions based on individual best positions, while FLC establishes a rule-based framework that governs the overall swarm behavior. By combining PSO and FLC, swarm robots excel in tasks requiring precision, speed, and adaptability, adapting to dynamic environments efficiently. Through a comprehensive literature review, the survey examines the coordination mechanisms facilitated by these algorithms. It highlights their potential applications, showcases their effectiveness in optimizing swarm robot behavior, and discusses the challenges and areas for improvement. The expected results of this research survey include a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of PSO and FLC algorithms in swarm robotics. The survey also summarizes key findings related to coordination strategies employed by swarm robots and offers recommendations for future research in this field. The findings highlight their potential to enhance coordination, precision, speed, and adaptability in various domains. By leveraging the collective intelligence of swarm robots, this research contributes to the ongoing advancements in swarm robotics and paves the way for transformative applications in real-world scenarios.
